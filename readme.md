This is a quick and dirty 'about me' web page I made in a couple of days: http://karim.kurst.co.uk/. It is built with ES6, Babel and ThreeJS - for the fun of it. I am just putting this out here in case it helps anyone for whatever reason. 

The code is not really well commented, there are a few utility classes I built, grabbed or ported over time, these live in the './lib' directory.

# Setup / Compile:

1) Install Gulp ( assumes you have NPM / NodeJS )

	npm install --global gulp

2) Install dependencies:

	npm install

3) Test/Debug

	gulp
