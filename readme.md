# Karim-CV:

Build with ES6 using Babel, this is a quick and dirty one page website I built in a couple of days to have a little info about me: http://karim.kurst.co.uk/. I am just putting this out here in case it helps anyone for whatever reason. 

The code is not really well commented, and there are a few of utility classes I built, used, taken, ported over time in the ./lib folder. 

# Setup / Compile:

1) Install Gulp ( assumes you have NPM / NodeJS )

	npm install --global gulp

2) Install dependencies:

	npm install

3) Test/Debug

	gulp
